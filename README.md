# Do Other Things
Some dot files so one can focus on doing other things.

This repo is a WIP, but may offer some good suggestions for the curious. It may not be ready for environment / user agnostic application yet.

## Philosophy
These dot files are _opinionated_ and not currently designed to be configurable. Frankly, these configurations just aren't yet mature enough to be configurable, but that is the hope someday. Perhaps that would be another project entirely.

The upside though is that once the repo is no longer a WIP, one should be able to install and be ready to go.

## Goals
- Support development with the following tools (languages, libraries, frameworks, etc.):
  - typescript
  - javascript
  - rust
  - react

## Contents
- .zshrc : for configuring zsh shell
- init.vim : for nvim configuration
